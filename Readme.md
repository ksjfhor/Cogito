beta 202403.25

## What is it?
COGITO is a first Person Immersive Sim Template Project for Godot Engine 4.
In comparison to other first person assets out there, which focus mostly on shooter mechanics, COGITO focuses on
providing a framework for creating interactable objects and items.

COGITO is made by [Philip Drobar](https://www.philipdrobar.com) with help from [these contributors](https://github.com/Phazorknight/Cogito/graphs/contributors).
